C# Homework Projects
This repository contains my C# homework assignments as part of my learning journey in backend development. Each project or task demonstrates different concepts and features of the C# programming language, including:

Basic syntax and data types

Control structures (if statements, loops)

Methods and classes

Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Error handling

Working with files

And more as I progress

These exercises are meant to help me practice and strengthen my understanding of C# and .NET as I move toward becoming a full stack developer.

Structure
Each homework task is organized into its own folder or file, labeled appropriately for easy reference.

These projects are created for educational purposes and may not follow production-level coding standards.
